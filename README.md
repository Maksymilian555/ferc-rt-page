# FERC RT Main Page

This page was created for the presentation of Flat Earth Rocket Corporation and Rocket Technologies. We want to show you all our news, products and images.

## What is our page about

We will show you all our news, images and info. We also want to popularize our products. It will all be about rockets, parachutes and engines. We want to fly to space, but the question is: how? Take a look at the Flat Earth Rocket Corporation website!
